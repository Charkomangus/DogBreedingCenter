The farmers are asking for our help now. We are tasked with creating a guard dog for a farm.
This dog would need to have a calm demeanor as it will be interacting with many people, including the children living there.

Additionally, it's sight must be keen, to be able to scope out would-be intruders. Finally, it needs to be trainable and extremely loyal to their owner.
