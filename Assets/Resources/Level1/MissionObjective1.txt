The hunters have now asked if we can create a dog suitable for hunting larger animals, like deer.
This dog would need to have good scent to track, have great endurance in order to be able to follow game and a strong bark so the hunter can follow. 

We should also make sure it is a large dog with long strong legs to be able to catch up and defend itself.
