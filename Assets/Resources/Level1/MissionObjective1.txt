The hunters now are asking if we can create a dog suitable for hunting larger animals, like dear.
This dog would need to have good scent to track, have great endurance in order to be able to follow game and a strong bark so the hunter can follow. 

We should also make sure he is a large dog with long strong legs to be able to catch up and defend itself.
