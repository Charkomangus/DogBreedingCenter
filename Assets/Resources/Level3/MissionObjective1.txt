The local police precinct is asking us to develop a dog to be partnered with their officers.

Dogs used in Search & Rescue are amongst the best examples of the species. Possessing an amazing ability to be trained, they tirelessly search for people using their scent to track down people buried under snow or stuck on a mountain trail.

They are able to focus on the task at hand and do not get distracted easily.
